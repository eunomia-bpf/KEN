### User Request

Monitors the rate of specific hardware interrupts and logs the interrupt sources

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s
", str(args->filename)); }'


You can refer to the above examples to write your own bpftrace program. Use a tool 
provided to execute your bpftrace program.
You should only write the bpftrace program itself.

Write a bpftrace program that traces or profile the following user request:

### User Request

Traces process forking events and logs the parent and child process IDs and command names.

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:

Write a bpftrace program that traces or profile the following user request:

### User Request

traces file read and write events and calculates the I/O size distribution for each file.

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:

Write a bpftrace program that traces or profile the following user request:

### User Request

Count page faults events by process

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

You can refer to the above examples to write your own bpftrace program. Use a tool 
provided to execute your bpftrace program.
You should only write the bpftrace program itself.

Run the bpftrace program：

Write a bpftrace program that traces or profile the following user request:

### User Request

Trace directory entry cache (dcache) lookups by process

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

You can refer to the above examples to write your own bpftrace program. Use a tool 
provided to execute your bpftrace program.
You should only write the bpftrace program itself.

Run the bpftrace program：

sudo timeout --preserve-status -s 2 20 bpftrace -e tracepoint:syscalls:sys_* { @[comm] = count(); }

with the following error and ouput:

ERROR: Can't attach to 690 probes because it exceeds the current limit of 512 probes.
You can increase the limit through the BPFTRACE_MAX_PROBES environment variable, but BE CAREFUL since a high number of probes attached can cause your system to crash.

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

### User Request

Print CPU scheduler run queue latency as a histogram

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:

You can refer to the above examples to write your own bpftrace program. Use a tool 
provided to execute your bpftrace program.
You should only write the bpftrace program itself.

Run the bpftrace program：

sudo timeout --preserve-status -s 2 20 bpftrace -e tracepoint:mm_compact_zone:mm_compaction_begin { printf("PID %d latency %d ms\n", pid, $ts - @[pid]); }

### User Request

Trace and report long atomic critical sections in the kernel

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

### User Request

Trace signals issued by the kill() syscall system-wide

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2

### User Request

Traces kernel mutex lock events and display locks statistics.

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:

Write a bpftrace program that traces or profile the following user request:

### User Request

Trace TCP round trip time (RTT) and print the sender and receiver IP addresses and ports

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

You can refer to the above examples to write your own bpftrace program. Use a tool 
provided to execute your bpftrace program.
You should only write the bpftrace program itself.

Run the bpftrace program：

        @port_dst = ntohs(args->skb->dev->ip_header->dest_port);
    }
    
    tracepoint:tcp:tcp_recvmsg {
        @delta = nsecs - @ts;
        @rtt = (@delta > @rtt ? @delta : @rtt);

Write a bpftrace program that traces or profile the following user request:

### User Request

Trace TCP round trip time (RTT) and print the sender and receiver IP addresses and ports

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s
", str(args->filename)); }'


You can refer to the above examples to write your own bpftrace program. Use a tool 
provided to execute your bpftrace program.
You should only write the bpftrace program itself.

Run the bpftrace program：

sudo timeout --preserve-status -s 2 20 bpftrace -e tracepoint:tcp:tcp_sendmsg {
		@ip_src = args->skb->dev->ip_header->saddr;
        @port_src = ntohs(args->skb->dev->ip_header->source_port);
        @ip_dst = args->skb->dev->ip_header->daddr;
        @port_dst = ntohs(args->skb->dev->ip_header->dest_port);
    }
    
    tracepoint:tcp:tcp_recvmsg {
        @delta = nsecs - @ts;
        @rtt = (@delta > @rtt ? @delta : @rtt);
        
        printf("Sender IP: %d:%d, Receiver IP: %d:%d\n", @ip_src, @port_src, @ip_dst, @port_dst);
        printf("RTT: %d ns\n", @rtt);
    }

### User Request

Summarize ZFS operation latency distribution as a histogram

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

### User Request

traces XFS reads, writes, opens, and fsyncs, and summarizes their latency as a power-of-2 histogram.

### Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with bpftrace:

Below are some simple examples of bpftrace usage:

# trace processes calling sleep
'kprobe:do_nanosleep { printf("PID %d sleeping...
", pid); }'

# count syscalls by process name
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Files opened by process
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_open { printf("%s %s
", comm, str(args->filename)); }'

# Syscall count by program
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Read bytes by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read /args->ret/ { @[comm] = sum(args->ret); }'

# Read size distribution by process:
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read { @[comm] = hist(args->ret); }'

# Show per-second syscall rates:
'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @ = count(); } interval:s:1 { print(@); clear(@); }'

# Trace disk size by process
'tracepoint:block:block_rq_issue { printf("%d %s %d
", pid, comm, args->bytes); }'

# Count page faults by process
'software:faults:1 { @[comm] = count(); }'

# Count LLC cache misses by process name and PID (uses PMCs):
'hardware:cache-misses:1000000 { @[comm, pid] = count(); }'

# Profile user-level stacks at 99 Hertz, for PID 189:
'profile:hz:99 /pid == 189/ { @[ustack] = count(); }'

# Files opened, for processes in the root cgroup-v2
'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /cgroup == cgroupid("/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/mycg")/ { printf("%s

You can refer to the above examples to write your own bpftrace program. Use a tool 
provided to execute your bpftrace program.
You should only write the bpftrace program itself.

Run the bpftrace program：

sudo timeout --preserve-status -s 2 20 bpftrace -e @[comm] = count()
    kprobe:xfs_file_read { @[comm] = count(); }
    kprobe:xfs_file_write { @[comm] = count(); }
    kprobe:xfs_file_open { @[comm] = count(); }
    kprobe:xfs_file_fsync { @[comm] = count(); }

with the following error and ouput:

stdin:1:1-2: ERROR: syntax error, unexpected map, expecting {
@[comm] = count()
